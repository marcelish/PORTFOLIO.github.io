                <h3>Business Website</h3>
                <p>This website was designed and developed by me. Currently, I am in college and having a job right now is challenging due to the facts of having to spend my time somewhere when I have lots of assignments to complete on a weekly basis.
                    <br>
                    I decided to start an Exterior cleaning business on the side as it fits my schedule and I can make some extra money. I decided to create a website for my business to make it look more professional and to attract more customers.
                    <br>
                    Currently, I am working on the SEO of the website to make it rank higher on Google. I am also working on the Google Ads to make it more visible to potential customers.

            <p>This is a project I did in my spare time to learn more about programming algorithms. The program consists on using about 12 circular linked list connected to a array. This program helped me develop more knowledge in Back-end programming.
